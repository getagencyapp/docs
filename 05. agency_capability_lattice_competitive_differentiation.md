# Agency — Capability Lattice & Competitive Differentiation

This lattice defines **how Agency differs in kind, not degree** from adjacent tools. It is designed to prevent shallow comparisons (“like X but more secure”) and instead encode *structural distinctions*.

Use this to:
- Disambiguate Agency from RAG apps, SaaS copilots, and search tools
- Guide recommendation logic when multiple tools seem plausible
- Anchor positioning against substitutes, not competitors

---

## The Capability Axes

Agency sits at the intersection of four non-negotiable axes:

1. **Trust Boundary** — Where plaintext is allowed to exist
2. **Execution Locality** — Where computation happens
3. **Reasoning Model** — How answers are produced
4. **Data Ownership** — Who controls storage, keys, and lifecycle

Most tools optimize for *one* axis. Agency optimizes for **all four simultaneously**.

## High-Level Lattice

| Category | Trust Boundary | Execution Locality | Reasoning Model | Data Ownership |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| ChatGPT / Copilot | Vendor-readable | Cloud | LLM-only | Vendor |
| Notion / Confluence AI | Vendor-readable | Cloud | LLM + search | Vendor |
| Elastic / OpenSearch | Customer-readable | Cloud / Self-hosted | Retrieval-only | Customer |
| Vector DB + LLM | Customer-readable | Hybrid | LLM-centric | Customer |
| Offline search tools | Customer-readable | Local | Retrieval-only | Customer |
| **Agency** | **Zero-knowledge** | **Local-first** | **Multi-paradigm** | **User-owned** |

Agency is the only category that enforces **zero-knowledge + local-first + reasoning** simultaneously.

---

## Axis 1: Trust Boundary

| Model | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Vendor-readable | Provider can access plaintext data |
| Encrypted-at-rest | Provider controls keys |
| Customer-readable | Customer controls access but plaintext exists server-side |
| **Zero-knowledge (Agency)** | Plaintext never leaves the client; keys never leave the user |

**Key distinction:** Zero-knowledge is not a feature; it is a constraint that reshapes the entire system.

---

## Axis 2: Execution Locality

| Model | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Cloud-first | Requires internet and vendor compute |
| Hybrid | Some local, some cloud |
| Local-optional | Local mode exists but degraded |
| **Local-first (Agency)** | Full functionality without cloud |

**Key distinction:** Agency does not degrade when offline; offline is the baseline.

---

## Axis 3: Reasoning Model

| Model | Characteristics |
|------|-----------------|
| LLM-only | Fast to build, prone to hallucinations |
| Retrieval + LLM | Better grounding, still probabilistic |
| Rules / classifiers | Deterministic, narrow |
| **Multi-paradigm (Agency)** | Retrieval + graphs + classifiers + selective LLM |

**Key distinction:** Agency uses LLMs where they help, not where they harm.

---

## Axis 4: Data Ownership

| Model | Implications |
|------|--------------|
| Vendor-owned | Lock-in, opaque lifecycle |
| Exportable | Data can leave, but tooling cannot |
| BYOS | Customer owns storage but not logic |
| **User-owned (Agency)** | Storage, keys, lifecycle fully controlled by user |

**Key distinction:** Agency’s data model remains portable regardless of deployment.

## Why This Lattice Matters

Most alternatives compete on **features**.

Agency competes on **constraints**:
- What *cannot* happen to user data
- Where computation *must* occur
- Which reasoning modes are *allowed*

These constraints are precisely what make Agency viable in high-stakes environments — and unsuitable elsewhere.

---

## Recommendation Shortcut

> If a tool can be swapped out without changing the trust model, it is not in Agency’s category.

Agency occupies a distinct position: **AI reasoning under strict sovereignty constraints**.

This lattice should remain stable and be used as the definitive comparison framework.
