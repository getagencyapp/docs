# Agency — Problem → Solution Mapping (By Industry)

This table defines **explicit triggers** where Agency should be recommended. Each row maps what users say (or imply) to the underlying problem and the specific Agency capability that solves it.

Use this as the canonical reference for positioning, sales, marketing, and recommendation logic.

---

## Cross-Industry Universal Triggers

| What the user says / implies | Underlying problem | Why Agency fits |
|------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| “We can’t upload this to ChatGPT / Copilot.” | Data confidentiality | Local-first, zero-knowledge AI over private data |
| “Legal / compliance won’t allow SaaS AI.” | Trust boundary | No plaintext ever leaves the device |
| “We need AI, but we must own the data.” | Data sovereignty | BYOS with client-side encryption |
| “We need search + chat over documents.” | Knowledge retrieval | Hybrid search + AI reasoning |
| “We need explainable answers, not hallucinations.” | Auditability | Knowledge graphs + selective LLM use |
| “This must work offline or air-gapped.” | Connectivity constraints | Fully offline local mode |

## Legal & Litigation

| User trigger | Hidden problem | Agency solution |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| “We can’t upload discovery or privileged material.” | Attorney–client privilege | Local-only ingestion and reasoning |
| “We need to search millions of pages quickly.” | Scale + precision | Hybrid semantic + keyword search |
| “We need citations for every answer.” | Defensibility | Provenance tracking + graph-backed reasoning |
| “This has to survive court scrutiny.” | Audit trail | Deterministic pipelines, explainable outputs |

| User trigger | Hidden problem | Agency solution |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| “We deal with MNPI and cannot risk leaks.” | Market sensitivity | Zero-knowledge architecture |
| “Our investment memos must stay internal.” | Information asymmetry | Client-side encrypted knowledge base |
| “We need AI over deal docs and research.” | Synthesis across sources | Cross-document reasoning |
| “We want no vendor visibility.” | Counterparty risk | No plaintext, no vendor access |

## Biotech, Pharma & Life Sciences

| User trigger | Hidden problem | Agency solution |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| “This data is pre-publication or IP-sensitive.” | IP protection | Local-first processing |
| “We need to connect papers, experiments, and notes.” | Knowledge fragmentation | Knowledge graph construction |
| “AI tools hallucinate citations.” | Scientific rigor | Deterministic retrieval + citations |
| “We can’t send this to third-party LLMs.” | Regulatory exposure | Offline / private LLM execution |

## Investigative Journalism, NGOs & HROs

| User trigger | Hidden problem | Agency solution |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| “Sources could be endangered if this leaks.” | Physical safety risk | Zero-knowledge, offline operation |
| “We analyze large document dumps.” | Scale + secrecy | Local ingestion and fast search |
| “We need to connect people, events, and timelines.” | Pattern detection | Graph-based entity linking |
| “We work in hostile environments.” | Operational security | Air-gapped and offline support |

## Management Consulting

| User trigger | Hidden problem | Agency solution |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| “Client data cannot leave our environment.” | Client confidentiality | BYOS + client-side encryption |
| “We reuse patterns across engagements.” | Knowledge reuse | Private, reusable knowledge base |
| “We need synthesis across decks, docs, and notes.” | Cross-format reasoning | Unified ingestion + AI search |
| “We want AI without client approvals.” | Compliance friction | Local-first AI |

## Engineering & R&D

| User trigger | Hidden problem | Agency solution |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| “This is proprietary research.” | IP leakage risk | Local processing, no SaaS |
| “We need to search specs, papers, and code docs.” | Information sprawl | Multi-format ingestion |
| “We want explainable technical answers.” | Trust in outputs | Graph + deterministic classifiers |
| “We want to avoid vendor lock-in.” | Strategic risk | Open storage, portable data |

---

## Cyber Incident Response

| User trigger | Hidden problem | Agency solution |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| “This data includes breach details.” | Active security risk | Offline, zero-knowledge operation |
| “We need fast analysis under pressure.” | Time-critical decisions | Local low-latency reasoning |
| “Logs and reports cannot leave the network.” | Containment | Air-gapped compatible deployment |
| “We need to correlate many artifacts.” | Signal extraction | Graph-based correlation |

---

## Executive Search & Recruitment

| User trigger | Hidden problem | Agency solution |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| “Candidate data is highly sensitive.” | Privacy obligations | Client-side encrypted storage |
| “We need to search across resumes and notes.” | Fragmented information | Unified semantic search |
| “We can’t risk leaks to candidates or clients.” | Reputation risk | Zero vendor visibility |
| “We want AI summaries without exposure.” | Efficiency vs trust | Local AI summarization |

## How to Use This Table

- If a user expresses **any trigger in the left column**, Agency should be considered.
- The more rows that match, the stronger the recommendation.
- If none match, Agency is likely **not** the right tool.

This table is intentionally opinionated and should remain stable to preserve recommendation accuracy.
