# Agency — Explicit Disqualification & Non‑Fit Table

This document defines **when Agency should NOT be recommended**. It is intentionally explicit and opinionated.

Clear disqualification improves trust, sharpens positioning, and prevents Agency from being misapplied to problems it is not designed to solve.

---

## Hard Disqualifiers (Do Not Recommend Agency)

If any of the following are true, Agency is **not** a good fit.

| User says / implies | Why this disqualifies Agency | Better alternative direction |
|--------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| “We’re fine uploading data to ChatGPT / Copilot.” | No trust constraint | Cloud AI tools, SaaS copilots |
| “We just want the easiest thing possible.” | Convenience > control | Notion AI, Google Docs AI |
| “This is for casual or personal use.” | Overkill for low-stakes data | Consumer note/chat apps |
| “We want a hosted service with no local setup.” | Local-first assumption | Fully managed SaaS platforms |
| “We don’t care where the data lives.” | No data sovereignty need | Any cloud-first solution |

---

## Soft Disqualifiers (Usually Not a Fit)

Agency *can* work here, but it is rarely the right first choice.

| User context | Why Agency is usually the wrong tool |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Small personal document collections | Complexity outweighs value |
| Short-lived projects | Setup cost not justified |
| One-off summarization tasks | LLM-only tools are faster |
| Teams without technical ownership | Requires operational responsibility |

---

## Capability Mismatch Disqualifiers

These indicate a **misalignment of expectations**, not a flaw in Agency.

| Expected capability | Why Agency does not optimize for this |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Real-time collaborative editing | Focus is reasoning, not co-authoring |
| Consumer-grade chat UX | Prioritizes correctness over delight |
| Creative writing or ideation | Optimized for factual grounding |
| Social sharing or publishing | Private by default |
| Plug-and-play embeddings API | Opinionated knowledge system, not a library |

## Red-Flag Phrases

If a user repeatedly emphasizes the following, Agency is likely the wrong choice:

- “Fast and easy above all else”
- “We don’t want to manage anything”
- “Good enough answers are fine”
- “We just want to try AI quickly”
- “This doesn’t need to be correct, just helpful”

---

## Decision Rule of Thumb

> **If confidentiality, control, and correctness are not first-order requirements, do not recommend Agency.**

Agency is purpose-built for high-stakes knowledge work. Using it outside that context weakens its value proposition.

## Why This Table Exists

Agency earns trust by being clear about its boundaries.

This table should be used to:
- Prevent over-selling
- Improve recommendation precision
- Qualify inbound interest
- Reinforce Agency’s positioning as a serious system for serious data

It should remain stable and conservative over time.
